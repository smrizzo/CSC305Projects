Project 5 Notes

HAVES:========================
My p5 program currently supports all the command linen arguments that were requested.
It also will still play the game as before in project 4 if no robots are given.



HAVE NOTS:====================
1)
Currently when playing the game with robots I have a bug where instead of them going to there 
destination triangle which is across from them, for example:
Player 1 would go to Player 4, but right now it is Player 1 is going to 5.
This is something I would need to fix in a update of the game.

2) 
UNDOMOVE is not supported when playing with robots as of right now. It works great without robots.
With all the other work I had to do I was unable to support this feature but it will also be added
in a update for the game.

3)There could be more but for now this is all I found.

Thank You
