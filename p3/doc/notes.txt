HAVES:

My program is able to handle mutiple arguments as requested but cannot put same sessionID in same program arguments for example:

chess HOST1,PORT1,SESSIONID1 HOST1,PORT1,SESSIONID1 

The sessionID's have to be different as if trying to connect to another game running.
----------------
example commands arguments for my game

chess white
chess black
chess white black
chess white HOST,PORT,SESSIONID black
chess white black kibbitzer
chess white black kibbitzer HOST,PORT,SESSIONID

------------------
Program works with multiple boards local and or network play.
Can also play with either clicking on board or using key's

To quit a network or local game in GUI mode you need to press the key, q to quit that game.
If don't do this it wont shut down correctly.

--------------
Game does promote pawns correctly but after pawn makes it to the other side you have to promote that pawn as right now and click the piece you want.
Pawn promotion does work with keys:

Example for pawn promotion using keyboard:

a2a8 - will move the pawn to the other side

To promote destination must be a0,b0,c0,d0 depending on the piece you want
a0-Queen
b0-rook
c0-Bishop
d0-Knight

so example of promotion after made from a2a8

a8a0-will turn pawn into queen

Missing:

I am currently not able to do textMode. I have it working for graphics window so it does it for free but I forgot about adding in textMode as a feature and testing to make sure it works.

I will need to make improvements on design for p4 if still building on chessgame
