# turnin

This git repository is for you to turn in your assignments.  You should
copy your work into this directory, using the EXACT names that are given
in the description in the class materials.

The steps to get set up on github for this class are as follows:

    *  Go to the URL that was given to you, and accept the assignment.  

    *  (Optional)  Install the "git" tools on your computer, if they're
       not already there.  Command-line versions are availabe from
       https://git-scm.com/downloads .  If you have trouble with this,
       you can always use the Unix servers, unix1.csc.calpoly.edu through
       unix5.csc.calpoly.edu.

    *  Set up your account on the Unix server for CSC 305.  You do this
       by editing the file ".mybashrc" to include the following:
            source /home/wffoote/public/set_env_305

    *  Wait for the instructor to invite you to the "Students" team.
       If necessary, remind them, and maybe mention that you should be
       listed as an "outside ollaborator."  When you've been invited, 
       you'll get an e-mail, and an "accept information" link will be 
       available at the organization homepage.  Accept the invitation.

    *  Go to the organization homepage, https://github.com/CalPolyCPE305-F18 .
       Click on "repositories," then "materials."

    *  Pick a directory on your computer, or on your account on the Unix
       server where you'll be storing the class materials.  Go to that
       directory.  
       
    *  Clone the class materials repository to your computer:  Type
       "git clone" followed by the address given in the "clone" text
       box on the github web page.  This will create a directory called
       "materials" where the class materials are stored.  DO NOT CLICK ON 
       "Donwload ZIP"!

    *  cd into the materials, and type "git pull."  It should tell you that
       it's already up to date.  In the future, you can use this command to
       get any changes to the class materials.

    *  Read the file info/setup.txt, where you'll find further setup
       instructions.
