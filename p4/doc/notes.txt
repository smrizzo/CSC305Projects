HAVES:

I currently have everything working still for chess that I did in p3.
I also have implemented everything for chinese checkers in p4.

HAVE NOTS:

I have all the functionality of chess and chinese checkers for local play, however I feel my design needs to be improved.

I implemented chinese checkers with the same abstract Piece class that chess used, but other than that they are separeate.

A better design would be to have both chess and chinese checkers extending from same View class, Controller Class, Model Class, and maybe more.
That will be something I will improve on in the future.
